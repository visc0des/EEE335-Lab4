/* 

	Description:

		Iteration of spooler program with strict alternation solution. 

	Plan:

		Okay, we will have a global variable called <turn>. 
		This will keep track of which thread gets to access the spooler 
		at once time. 

		When turn = 0, it's the producer's turn to be in the spooler.
		When turn = 1, it's the printer's turn to be in the spooler.

		I'll just be following the examples from the class notes.
